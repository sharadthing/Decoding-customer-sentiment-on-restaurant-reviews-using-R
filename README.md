# Restaurant Reviews Sentiment Analysis

*Technologies:* R, tidyverse, tm, caret, ggplot2, text mining, machine learning

---

### Project Overview

Performed comprehensive sentiment analysis on a restaurant review dataset using R and advanced machine learning techniques.

---

### Key Highlights

- Implemented a robust data cleaning pipeline addressing missing values, text preprocessing (stemming, stopword removal), and feature engineering.
